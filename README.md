## Welcome to ChemLAB

Chemistry is a part of every student's curriculum, whether as a mandatory class in high school or a base class in college. It is considered one of the most difficult, out of base classes for most majors and in some cases, first-year students don't have a good science background for learning chemistry topics and tend to struggle the most. This functional programming language aims to aid students in their development of chemistry skills, including equation balancing, conversions, and periodic table components. Some of these concepts we have experienced some struggle and know that others could benefit from having a resource to learn and place to practice.


### Language Features

Some of the language features included are:
- Conversions
- element and compound bonding
- balancing and verifying balancing
- basic comparation and algebraic expressions

### Examples

Using ChemLAB we can easily bond elements, balance the result and get the resulting details of the balanced compound like so:
```
  [elem1=form(1)&form(8)]
  [elem1=elem1|elem1]
  [detail(elem1)]
```
**More examples will be added as we work through our implementation**

Try it out! Just clone our repo and start programming yourself!

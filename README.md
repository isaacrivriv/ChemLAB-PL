## Welcome to ChemLAB

Chemistry is a part of every student's curriculum, whether as a mandatory class in high school or a base class in college. It is considered one of the most difficult, out of base classes for most majors and in some cases, first-year students don't have a good science background for learning chemistry topics and tend to struggle the most. This functional programming language aims to aid students in their development of chemistry skills, including equation balancing, conversions, and periodic table components. Some of these concepts we have experienced some struggle and know that others could benefit from having a resource to learn and place to practice.


### Language Features

Some of the language features included are:
- Conversions
- element bonding
- balancing equations and verifying if an equation is balanced
- basic comparation and algebraic expressions
- Immutability of variables
- Function composition

### Examples

Using ChemLAB we can easily bond elements and get details of balancing the equation like so:
```
  [elem1=form(1)&form(8);]
  [balance(elem1 -> elem1)]
```

We can also easily convert mass and to mols of an element like so
```
  [detail(convert(form(2), 2.9, g, mol))]
```
**More examples will be added as we work through our implementation**

^^ Should ignore this cause this is just a comment
[test=36;][detail(test)]
^^ Not Full working just placeholder code
[elem1=form(23);]
[elemBond=elem1&form(2);]
[balanced?(elemBond -> elemBond)]
[HNO3=form(14);]
[detail (HNO3)]
[ 
if balanced?(elemBond  -> elemBond) then 
    detail(TRUE) 
else 
    detail(FALSE)
]
[detail (32,31.4)]
[detail (32,31.4,TRUE)]
[ 
if if balanced?(elemBond -> elemBond) 
    then TRUE 
    else FALSE ^^ We could say this is similar to the ternary operator in python. Obviously this is very unnecesary code just for a demonstration
then detail(TRUE) 
else detail(FALSE)
]
[feO=form(26)&form(8);]
[Car=form(6);]
[fe=form(26);]
[CO=form(6)&form(8);]
[detail(CO)]
[
    test = balance(feO, Car 1 -> form(8)&form(6), fe );

[
    detail(convert(HNO3, 34, ft, cme))
]
^^ Prefixes could add up to make new prefixes and should be defined separate from unit
[
    detail(convert(HNO3, 2.9, ft, c c me))
]
^^ Grammar also allows some bit crazy things to be defined like this
[ t = r = x = 23;;;]
[detail(t,r,x)]
^^ Not implemented yet. Will give error if uncommented.
^^ Also missing convert to operation which grammar is unsupported to for now
^^ [elemBond=form(14)&form(52);]
^^ [elemBond=elemBond|;]
^^ [ if balanced?(elemBond) then detail(TRUE) else elemBond=elemBond|;]
